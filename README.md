# PlexCache-D V3.2: Automate Plex Media Management
### Updated 3/3/26

# Notice - Update to new Dockerised version. For instructions and discussion - https://github.com/StudioNirin/PlexCache-D/discussions/81 

## Current Bugs / Todo List

Now moved to a discussion page [HERE](https://github.com/StudioNirin/PlexCache-D/discussions/16)

## Overview
Automate Plex media management: Efficiently transfer media from the On Deck/Watchlist to the cache, and seamlessly move watched media back to their respective locations.
An updated version of the "PlexCache-Refactored" script with various bugfixes and improvements. Hopefully fixed and improved anyway, time will tell!

PlexCache efficiently transfers media from the On Deck/Watchlist to the cache and moves watched media back to their respective locations. This Python script reduces energy consumption by minimizing the need to spin up the array/hard drive(s) when watching recurrent media like TV series. It achieves this by moving the media from the OnDeck and watchlist for the main user and/or other users. For TV shows/anime, it also fetches the next specified number of episodes.

## Features
The original PlexCache app only worked for local users for most features, due to API limitations. V1 of Plexcache-r had some similar limitations, but a lot of those have now been fixed.

- Fetch a specified number of episodes from the "onDeck" for the main user and other users (Local/Remote).
- Skip fetching onDeck media for specified users (Local/Remote).
- Fetch a specified number of episodes from the "watchlist" for the main user and other users (Local/Remote).
- Skip fetching watchlist media for specified users (Local/Remote).
- (New v2) - .plexcached backup system, so files are not moved off the array and are instead archived to prevent unecessary move operations.
- Search only the specified libraries.
- Check for free space before moving any file.
- (New v2) - Cache retention policies, with automatic removals based on age/priority settings.
- (New v3) - **Web UI Dashboard** - Browser-based interface for monitoring and configuration.
- (New v3) - **Scheduled Runs** - Automatic execution with interval or cron scheduling.
- (New v3) - **Enhanced Webhooks** - Discord and Slack rich message formatting with granular notification levels (Summary, Activity, Errors, Warnings).
- (New v3) - **Stop Button** - Abort running operations gracefully from the Web UI.
- (New v3) - **Smart Error Handling** - Migration stops early on critical errors (disk full, permissions).
- (New v3) - **Async Maintenance** - Background thread execution for maintenance actions (restore, sync, protect, delete, fix) with real-time progress.
- (New v3) - **Parallel File Operations** - Concurrent file moves/copies with configurable worker count.
- (New v3) - **Cache Health Audit** - Detect unprotected files, orphaned backups, stale entries with one-click fixes.
- (New v3) - **ZFS Support** - Automatic detection of ZFS pool-only shares with correct path resolution.
- (New v3) - **Min Free Space** - Safety floor setting to prevent caching when cache drive space is low.
- (New v3) - **Docker Support** - Official container with Unraid template, auto-setup, and path translation.
- (New v3) - **Byte-Level Progress** - Smooth progress bar updates every 10MB during file copies, with ETA from copy rate.
- (New v3.1) - **Plex OAuth Authentication** - Optional login with Plex identity verification (server owner), popup-based OAuth flow, session cookies, rate limiting, CSRF protection, and security headers.
- (New v3.1) - **Password Fallback** - Optional local password authentication alongside Plex OAuth.
- (New v3.1) - **Duplicate File Detection** - Surface duplicate warnings on Dashboard and Maintenance pages.
- (New v3.1) - **Persistent Auth Sessions** - Login sessions survive container restarts.
- (New v3.1) - **Vendored Frontend Libraries** - Lucide icons and HTMX served locally, no external CDN dependencies.
- (New v3.1) - **Security Hardening** - CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and Referrer-Policy headers.
- (New v3.2) - **Extension-Free Caching** - Cache ALL sibling files (artwork, NFOs, metadata) alongside videos, not just subtitles. Eliminates array spinups caused by Plex reading poster.jpg, .nfo, or other small files.
- (New v3.2) - **Reference-Counted Directory Files** - Shared files like `poster.jpg` stay cached until the last video in the directory is evicted.
- (New v3.2) - **Sidecar File Indicators** - Dashboard shows sidecar file counts alongside subtitle counts in the cache browser.
- Move watched media present on the cache drive back to the array.
- Move all sibling files (subtitles, artwork, metadata) along with the media moved to or from the cache.
- Filter media older than a specified number of days.
- Run in debug mode for testing.
- Use of a log file for easy debugging.
- Use caching system to avoid wastful memory usage and cpu cycles.
- Use of multitasking to optimize file transfer time.
- Exit the script if any active session or skip the currently playing media.
- Send Webhook/Unraid notifications with configurable trigger levels.
- (New v2) - Unraid Mover exclusion file. This file also allows for manual custom entries.

> **Note:** When running via Docker, the default port is **5757**. When running via CLI, the default port is **5000**.

## Docker Installation (Recommended for Unraid)

PlexCache-D is available as a Docker container, ideal for Unraid users.

**Container Registry:** `ghcr.io/studionirin/plexcache-d`

### Quick Start

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name plexcache-d \
  -p 5757:5757 \
  -v /mnt/user/appdata/plexcache:/config \
  -v /mnt/cache:/mnt/cache \
  -v /mnt/user0:/mnt/user0 \
  -v /mnt/user:/mnt/user \
  -e PUID=99 \
  -e PGID=100 \
  -e TZ=America/Los_Angeles \
  ghcr.io/studionirin/plexcache-d:latest
```

### Unraid Installation

1. Go to **Docker** → **Add Container**
2. Set **Repository**: `ghcr.io/studionirin/plexcache-d:latest`
3. Add required volume mappings:
   - `/config` → `/mnt/user/appdata/plexcache`
   - `/mnt/cache` → `/mnt/cache` (read-write)
   - `/mnt/user0` → `/mnt/user0` (read-write)
   - `/mnt/user` → `/mnt/user` (read-write)
4. Set **WebUI**: `http://[IP]:[PORT:5757]`
5. Set a port mapping: `5757:5757`
6. Click **Apply**

> **Important:** All media paths (`/mnt/cache`, `/mnt/user0`, `/mnt/user`) must be **read-write** for PlexCache-D to move files between cache and array.

### First Run

Open `http://[YOUR_IP]:5757` - the Setup Wizard will guide you through:
- Plex connection (OAuth or manual token)
- Library selection with cacheable options
- User selection for OnDeck/Watchlist monitoring
- Caching behavior configuration
- Security settings (optional Plex OAuth authentication)

**Important:** Volume paths for `/mnt/cache`, `/mnt/user0`, and `/mnt/user` must match exactly between container and host for Plex path resolution.

See `docker/UNRAID_SETUP.md` for detailed Unraid setup instructions including CA Mover Tuning integration.

## Installation and Setup

There are three ways to run PlexCache-D, depending on your preference:

| | Docker | Manual + Web UI | Manual + CLI |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Best for** | Unraid users who prefer containers | Unraid/Linux users who prefer native installs | Lightweight, script-only usage |
| **Web dashboard** | Yes (always on) | Yes (always on) | No |
| **Scheduling** | Built-in (via Web UI) | Built-in (via Web UI) | External (cron / User Scripts) |
| **Auto-start** | Docker restart policy | systemd or User Scripts plugin | cron `@reboot` or User Scripts |
| **Default port** | 5757 | 5000 | N/A |
| **Setup** | Web UI wizard on first visit | Web UI wizard on first visit | `--setup` CLI wizard |

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

See the [Docker Installation](#docker-installation-recommended-for-unraid) section above.

### Option 2: Manual Install + Web UI

This runs PlexCache-D as a persistent web server with dashboard, scheduler, and all features.

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.9+
- Git (to clone the repo)

**Install:**
```bash
cd /mnt/user/appdata
git clone https://github.com/StudioNirin/PlexCache-D.git
cd PlexCache-D
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**Start the Web UI:**
```bash
python3 plexcache.py --web --host 0.0.0.0           # Listen on all interfaces, port 5000
python3 plexcache.py --web --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080  # Custom port
```

Then open `http://[YOUR_IP]:5000` in your browser. On first run, the Setup Wizard will guide you through configuration.

#### Auto-Start on Boot (Unraid -User Scripts Plugin)

The easiest way to auto-start on Unraid without Docker:

1. Install **User Scripts** from Community Apps (if not already installed)
2. Go to **Settings** → **User Scripts** → **Add New Script**
3. Name it `PlexCache-D Web UI`
4. Click the script name, then **Edit Script** and paste:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /mnt/user/appdata/PlexCache-D
nohup python3 plexcache.py --web --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

5. Set the schedule to **At Startup of Array**
6. Click **Apply**

> **Tip:** To stop the server, find the process with `ps aux | grep plexcache` and `kill` it, or use the User Scripts **Stop** button if available.

#### Auto-Start on Boot (Generic Linux -systemd)

For non-Unraid Linux systems, create a systemd service:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/plexcache-d.service
```

```ini
[Unit]
Description=PlexCache-D Web UI
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/opt/PlexCache-D
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 plexcache.py --web --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable plexcache-d
sudo systemctl start plexcache-d
```

Check status with `sudo systemctl status plexcache-d` and logs with `journalctl -u plexcache-d -f`.

### Option 3: Manual Install + CLI Only

This is the original V1/V2 mode -no web server, no dashboard. PlexCache-D runs once, performs caching/eviction, and exits. You schedule it externally.

**Install** (same as Option 2):
```bash
cd /mnt/user/appdata
git clone https://github.com/StudioNirin/PlexCache-D.git
cd PlexCache-D
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**First-time setup:**
```bash
python3 plexcache.py --setup
```

**Run manually:**
```bash
python3 plexcache.py                     # Normal run
python3 plexcache.py --dry-run --verbose # Test run with full debug output
```

#### Schedule with Cron

```bash
crontab -e
```

```
# Run PlexCache-D every 6 hours
0 */6 * * * cd /mnt/user/appdata/PlexCache-D && python3 plexcache.py >> /mnt/user/appdata/PlexCache-D/logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

#### Schedule with Unraid User Scripts

1. Install **User Scripts** from Community Apps
2. **Add New Script** → name it `PlexCache-D`
3. **Edit Script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /mnt/user/appdata/PlexCache-D
python3 plexcache.py
```

4. Set schedule (e.g., **Custom** → `0 */6 * * *` for every 6 hours)
5. Click **Apply**

For additional help, check the [Wiki](https://github.com/StudioNirin/PlexCache-D/wiki) for detailed guides. If something doesn't make sense or doesn't work, please open a new issue. But don't be upset if the answer is in the Wiki and we mock you for not reading it thoroughly first.

## Notes

This script might be compatible with other systems, especially Linux-based ones, although I have primarily tested it on Unraid with plex as docker container. While I cannot support every case, it's worth checking the GitHub issues to see if your specific case has already been discussed. Particularly worth checking the original Bexem repo issues page.
I will still try to help out, but please note that I make no promises in providing assistance for every scenario.
**It is highly advised to use the setup script.**

## Known Limitations

### Remote/Network Storage

**The `.plexcached` backup system does NOT work with remote or network-attached storage** (e.g., Synology NAS mounted via SMB/NFS).

Why this is a problem:
- The Unraid mover only moves files on the local array, not remote mounts
- `.plexcached` backups on remote storage won't protect against anything
- Remote NAS is typically "always-on" anyway, so there's no array spinup savings

**Recommendation:** In the setup wizard or settings, set libraries on remote storage as **non-cacheable** (`enabled: false` in path_mappings). This prevents PlexCache-D from attempting to manage files it cannot properly protect.

### Dynamix File Integrity False Positives

If you use the **Dynamix File Integrity** plugin on Unraid, you may see "SHA256 hash key mismatch" errors for files managed by PlexCache-D. **These are false positives, not actual corruption.**

Why this happens:
- Dynamix records hashes using the original filename (e.g., `movie.mkv`)
- PlexCache-D renames array files to `.plexcached` (e.g., `movie.mkv.plexcached`)
- Dynamix can't find the original filename and reports it as corrupted/missing

**Your files are intact.** The rename operation does not modify file contents. You can verify by comparing MD5/SHA256 hashes of the cache copy and `.plexcached` backup - they will match.

**Recommendations:**
- Exclude `*.plexcached` files from Dynamix scanning
- Or rebuild the Dynamix hash database after PlexCache-D has been running
- Or exclude PlexCache-D managed directories from integrity scanning

## Acknowledgments

It seems we all owe a debt of thanks to someone called brimur[^3] for providing the script that served as the foundation and inspiration for this project. That was long before my time on it though, the first iteration I saw was by bexem[^4], who also has my thanks. But the biggest contributor to this continuation of the project was by bbergle[^5], who put in all the work on refactoring and cleaning up all the code into bite-sized chunks that were understandable to a novice like myself. All I did then was go through it all and try and make the wierd janky Plex API actually kinda work, for what I needed it to do anyway!

And my first personal thankyou to [Brandon-Haney](https://github.com/Brandon-Haney) who has contributed a whole bunch of updates. I haven't yet merged them as of writing this, but he's gone through basically every file so I figured he deserved a pre-emptive thanks!


[^1]: Remote users do not have individual watchlists accessible by the API. It's unfortunately not a thing. So instead I am using the available RSS feed as a workaround. The downside of this is... 
[^2]: ...that it is an all-or-nothing proposal for remote users. Local users can still be toggled on a per-user basis.
